		<h3>Questions found on Internet</h3>
		<div class="java">
			<dl>
				<dt>
				What is the ResourceBundle class?
				<dd>
					The ResourceBundle class is used to store locale-specific resources that can be loaded by a program to tailor the programâ€™s appearance to the particular locale in which it is being run.
				</dd>

				<dt class="oop">
				Describe the principles of OOPS.
				<dd>
					There are three main principals of oops which are called Polymorphism, Inheritance and Encapsulation.
				</dd>

				<dt>
				Q: 	

				What is the difference between an Interface and an Abstract class?
				<dd>
					A: 	An abstract class can have instance methods that implement a default behavior. An Interface can only declare constants and instance methods, but cannot implement default behavior and all methods are implicitly abstract. An interface has all public members and no implementation. An abstract class is a class which may have the usual flavors of class members (private, protected, etc.), but has some abstract methods.
				</dd>

				<dt>
				What is implicit casting?
				<dd><pre>
Implicit casting is the process of simply assigning one entity to another without any transformation guidance to the compiler. This type of casting is not permitted in all kinds of transformations and may not work for all scenarios.

Example

int i = 1000;

long j = i; //Implicit casting
					</pre>
				</dd>
				<dt>
				Is sizeof a keyword in java?
				<dd>
					The sizeof operator is not a keyword
				</dd>

				<dt>
				What if I write static public void instead of public static void?
				<dd>
					Program compiles and runs properly.
				</dd>

				<dt>
				What do you understand by numeric promotion?
				<dd>
					The Numeric promotion is the conversion of a smaller numeric type to a larger numeric type, so that integral and floating-point operations may take place. In the numerical promotion process the byte, char, and short values are converted to int values. The int values are also converted to long values, if necessary. The long and float values are converted to double values, as required.
				</dd>
				<dt>
				How can I swap two variables without using a third variable?
				<dd><pre>
Add two variables and assign the value into First variable. Subtract the Second value with the result Value. and assign to Second variable. Subtract the Result of First Variable With Result of Second Variable and Assign to First Variable. Example:

int a=5,b=10;a=a+b; b=a-b; a=a-b;

An other approach to the same question

You use an XOR swap.

for example:

int a = 5; int b = 10;
a = a ^ b;
b = a ^ b;
a = a ^ b;

				<dt>
				Does Map interface extends Collection ?
				<dd>
					No. Map instances have methods to return collection, entrySet(), keySet(), values().
				</dd>

				
				<dt>Can you write: a) 'p'-'k' and whats the result? b) char c=77?
				<dd>
					a) Yes. Both are converted to int and result is int.
					<br> b) Yes. Result is 'M'.
				</dd>
				
				
				<dt>How
				<pre>
for (String item : someList) {
    System.out.println(item);
}
				</pre>
				code works?
				<dd>
					It is equivalent to
					<pre>
for(Iterator<String> i = someList.iterator(); i.hasNext(); ) {
    String item = i.next();
    System.out.println(item);
}						
					</pre>
				</dd>
				
				<dt>In
				<pre>
for(String s : myCollection.expensiveListGeneration()){
      doSomething();
}</pre>
				how many times is expensiveListGeneration() invoked?
				<dd>Once. See previous question.</dd>
				
				<dt> How for statement is executed?
				<dd>
					<pre>
for (initialization; termination;
     increment) {
    statement(s)
}						
					</pre>
					
    The initialization expression initializes the loop; it's executed once, as the loop begins.
    <br>When the termination expression evaluates to false, the loop terminates.
    <br>The increment expression is invoked after each iteration through the loop; it is perfectly acceptable for this expression to increment or decrement a value.

				</dd>

				<dt>
				How to remove a character from string?
				<dd>
					Cannot be done without creating ne string.
					<br>occurrence - str.replace("char","")
					<br>from position - str.substring(0, index) + str.substring(index+1)
					<br>StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(str); sb.deleteCharAt(index); sb.toString();
				</dd>
